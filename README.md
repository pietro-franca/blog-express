# Blog Express

Blog Express is a simple program that simulates the operation of a web blog. From the admin page, you can:

- Create a new post
- Edit and update a post
- Delete a post

And on the home page, view a list of all posts made so far, each with:

- Title
- Content
- Creation Date
- Update Date

## Languages and Tools

The program's logic was written predominantly in **Javascript**, using **HTML** integrated with **EJS** to create dynamic pages, and **CSS** to style these pages.

The **Express framework** was used to integrate the backend into the program, albeit in a more basic way. It allowed for page redirection using routes and GET and POST requests.
